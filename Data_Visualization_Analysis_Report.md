## Abstract / Summary

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of a Python-based data visualization system designed to examine sales and expenses data across a 12-month business cycle. The implementation employs two complementary visualization techniques—bar charts and scatter plots—to address distinct analytical questions and provide actionable business insights. Key findings include a strong positive correlation (r = 0.997) between sales and expenses, clear seasonal sales patterns with peak performance in December ($78,000), and consistent operational efficiency with expenses maintaining 65-67% of sales revenue. The technical implementation demonstrates best practices in data visualization, statistical analysis, and modular software design.

## Introduction

### Background

In today's data-driven business environment, effective visualization of financial metrics is crucial for strategic decision-making and operational optimization. This study examines the implementation of a comprehensive data visualization dashboard that analyzes the relationship between sales performance and operational expenses over a complete fiscal year.

### Business Context

The analysis focuses on monthly sales and expense data spanning January through December, representing a typical business cycle. Understanding these relationships enables:

- **Strategic Planning**: Identifying seasonal trends and growth opportunities
- **Operational Efficiency**: Monitoring expense ratios and cost control
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting future expenses based on sales projections
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying areas for improvement and resource allocation

### Research Objectives

This implementation addresses three primary research questions:

1. **Temporal Analysis**: How do monthly sales vary throughout the year, and what seasonal patterns emerge?
2. **Relationship Analysis**: What is the nature and strength of the relationship between sales revenue and operational expenses?
3. **Predictive Capability**: Can expense levels be accurately predicted based on sales performance?

- create_sample_data()     # Synthetic dataset generation
- display_data_info()      # Exploratory data analysis
- create_monthly_sales_chart()    # Temporal visualization
- create_sales_expenses_scatter() # Correlation analysis
- main()                   # Orchestration and execution
```

### Data Structure

#### Dataset Specifications

- **Temporal Scope**: 12 months (January - December)
- **Variables**: Month (categorical), Sales (continuous), Expenses (continuous)
- **Data Range**: Sales ($45,000 - $78,000), Expenses ($32,000 - $52,000)
- **Format**: CSV with header row

#### Sample Data Overview

```csv
Month,Sales,Expenses
January,45000,32000
